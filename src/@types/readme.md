# Why @Types?

Because of the at, the foulder will stay at the top of the foulder src.

By having the name Type, it'll have the Typescript Icon.

It coulde be any other name.

## styles.**d**.ts

d.ts means inside this file it'll only have definition typescript codes, nothing but it.

For instance, if Button.tsx was Button.d.tsx, it could only have the "type" property and the rest code should not be put inside there.
